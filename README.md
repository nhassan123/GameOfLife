# Conway's Game Of Life
A simulation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written in Python. 
## Installation
The following libraries are required.
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
## Test Cases
You can run the script using the default parameters.
```
python3 ConwayGame.py
```
The grid size is 100 and the update interval is set to 50.
You can also set your own parameters to adjust the size of the grid and the udate speed through the command line. Setting a higher interval value results in the simulation running slower. 
```
python3 ConwayGame.py --grid-size 200 --interval 100
```
